This simulator was designed for simulating the miscible displacement pipe flows, was mainly carried out at Ian Frigarrd's lab in the 
departement of mathematics at the university of British Columbia in years of 2014-2015 under the grant project jointly finantially supported by NSERC and Schlumberger.

This is based on the several libraies :

1. Deal.II version 8.4.0 (https://dealii.org/)
2. Trilinos project version 11.14 (https://trilinos.org/)  
3. P4est version 1.1 (https:www.p4est.org/)
4. Openmpi version 1.6.5 (https://www.open-mpi.org/)
